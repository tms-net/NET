# Collections and Data Structures
Similar data can often be handled more efficiently when stored and manipulated as a collection. You can use the System.Array class or the classes in the System.Collections, System.Collections.Generic, System.Collections.Concurrent, and System.Collections.Immutable namespaces to add, remove, and modify either individual elements or a range of elements in a collection.

## Common collection features
All collections provide methods for adding, removing, or finding items in the collection.

 - The ability to enumerate the collection
 - Capacity and Count properties
 - The ability to manipulate collection
